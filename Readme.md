This is Pnuemonia detection project which can help in early diagnosis of Pnuemonia. The accuracy of model is 86%.
The model is built using Keras API with Tensorflow backend. The image data used consist of around 5000 images of chest x-rays with lables as either positive or negative.
The data can be found here -> https://www.kaggle.com/paultimothymooney/chest-xray-pneumonia
The libraries used for the project are Numpy(for basic numerical computations), 
                                       Opencv(for image processing),
                                       Tensorflow(computational framework),
                                       Keras(high level API),
                                       Flask(For creating API endpoint)
